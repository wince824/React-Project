 Q1. NPM, which stands for Node Package Manager, is a tool that comes with Node.js and is used to manage JavaScript packages. It allows developers to easily install, update, or remove third-party libraries that their applications depend on. In addition to managing packages, NPM can run scripts that automate tasks such as building a project, running tests, or starting a development server. Overall, NPM helps simplify project development by handling tools and dependencies efficiently.
 
 Q2. The package.json file is a crucial part of any Node.js or frontend project because it contains important information about the project. It lists the project’s name, version, description, author, and most importantly, all the dependencies and scripts used in the application. Whenever a package is installed through NPM, it is recorded in this file so that the project can be easily shared or rebuilt on another system. Essentially, package.json acts like the project’s configuration and documentation file in one place.
 
Q3. Vite is a modern build tool designed to provide a faster and smoother development experience for JavaScript applications. It offers a lightning-fast development server and instantly reloads changes using Hot Module Replacement (HMR), making the development process efficient and enjoyable. Unlike older bundlers like Webpack, Vite uses native browser modules to speed up both startup and updates. It works perfectly with popular frameworks such as React, Vue, and Svelte, making it a popular choice for modern web development.
